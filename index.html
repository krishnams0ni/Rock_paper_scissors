            Rock Paper Scissors, also known as Roshambo, is a popular hand game played around the world. The exact
            origins of the game are unknown, but it is believed to have originated in China over 2,000 years ago. It was
            later introduced to Japan in the 17th century and became popular among the samurai, who used it to settle
            disputes and make decisions.
            <br><br>
            The game spread throughout Asia and continues to be played in many countries today. It has even become a
            competitive sport, with international championships held annually. Despite its simple rules and ancient
            origins, the game continues to captivate people of all ages and remains a beloved pastime.
